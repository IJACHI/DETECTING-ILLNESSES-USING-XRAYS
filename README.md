# DETECTING-ILLNESSES-USING-XRAYS
This is a Capstone Project for Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialisation. 
This is my attempt to design a program that can detect various types of illnesses from Xrays. For a start, the project will focus on detection of covid19 patients, normal patients, and patients suffering from pneumonia. The dataset set for this project will be chest xrays of thousands of patients, gotten from Kaggle. If successful in this project, the project will be upscaled to detect many more abnormalities or sicknesses.

I selected the ResNet-18 machine model because it is a CNN (convolutional neural network) that is 18 layers deep. With ResNet-18 machine model it is possible to load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network has learned a feature representations for a wide range of images so it is capable of characterizing the images in my project.
